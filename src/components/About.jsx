              Hi, I'm Gnanesh Khandavilli. I enjoy learning new things and
              finding creative ways to solve problems. Iâ€™m passionate about
              technology and especially interested in full stack development. I
              like working on both the front-end and back-end of websites and
              applications, and I enjoy seeing how all the parts come together
              to create something useful.
            </p>
            <p>
              I'm always eager to improve my skills by exploring new frameworks,
              tools, and technologies. I believe in continuous learning and
              enjoy experimenting with different ideas to create better
              solutions. I enjoy teamwork and love sharing ideas, but I'm also
              comfortable working independently and staying focused on tasks. My
              goal is to grow as a full stack developer and contribute to
              building meaningful digital products that make a difference.
